Introduction to LEWD
====================

LEd Wall Deamon (LEWD) is software written in Python for the RGB LED wall at the
Technologia Incognita Hackerspace located in Amsterdam.

The project is divided into several parts:

    * The :ref:`low` level code.
    * :ref:`Examples`!
    * The simple :ref:`net` and :ref:`sync` code.
    * Higher level APIs. (Which are yet to be written)
